# AI, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning 
> This repository is in constant evolution to show and explain the technical side of AI and its applications to solve problems
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All models and cases on these repositories would be adapted to be used with the less possible requirement and computational power, to establish a minimum base to use them
