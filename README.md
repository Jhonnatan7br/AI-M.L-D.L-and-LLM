> This repository is in constant evolution to show and explain the technical side of AI and its applications to solve problems
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All models and cases on these repositories would be adapted to be used with the less possible requirement and computational power, to establish a minimum base to use them

### Machine Learning Models 

>[!NOTE]
> It was used ScikitLearn to do Supervised and unsupervised Learning

- Classification.ipynb
- Clustering Hierarchical & agglomerative.ipynb
- Clustering K-Means.ipynb
- Multi-Class Classification KNN & SVM.ipynb
- Multiclass Classification Decision-Tree.ipynb

 ### Deep Learning
>[!NOTE]
> Under construction, It was used PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras and Cyton to build and work models and its transformers

 ### NLP
>[!NOTE]
> Under construction, It was used PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras and Cyton to build and work models and its transformers
