    #### Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): 
    These are commonly used for image classification and object detection tasks. They are designed to recognize patterns in images by using filters that can detect edges, corners, and other features
    #### Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): 
    These are used for tasks that involve sequential data, such as speech recognition and natural language processing. They are designed to process data that has a temporal component, such as audio signals or text
    #### Generative adversarial networks (GANs): 
    These are used for generating new data that is similar to a given dataset. They consist of two neural networks that compete with each other to generate realistic data
