> This repository is in constant evolution to show and explain the technical side of AI and its applications to solve problems
> [!IMPORTANT]
> All models and cases on these repositories would be adapted to be used with the less possible requirement and computational power, to establish a minimum base to use them

 ### Deep Learning techniques 
>[!NOTE]
> Under construction, It was used PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras and Cyton to understand techniques and bases to made deep learning

> For future building
> Convolutional neural networks (CNNs): These are commonly used for image classification and object detection tasks. They are designed to recognize patterns in images by using filters that can detect edges, corners, and other features
> Recurrent neural networks (RNNs): These are used for tasks that involve sequential data, such as speech recognition and natural language processing. They are designed to process data that has a temporal component, such as audio signals or text
> Generative adversarial networks (GANs): These are used for generating new data that is similar to a given dataset. They consist of two neural networks that compete with each other to generate realistic data 

 ### NLP and some foundational models
>[!NOTE]
> Under construction, It was used PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras and Cyton to build and work models and its transformers

- Topic modeling with LSA, LDA and Word2Vec
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers)

> For future building
> GPT (Generative pre-trained transformer)
> ResNet (A deep neural network architecture for image classification)
> YOLOv5 (A real-time object detection system)
> CLIP (model developed by OpenAI that can understand the relationship between images and text)
